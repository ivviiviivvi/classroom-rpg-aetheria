# Portfolio Video Production Quick Start Guide

## Overview
This guide helps you quickly produce a professional hiring-focused portfolio video from the comprehensive script provided in `PORTFOLIO_VIDEO_SCRIPT.md`.

---

## Phase 1: Pre-Production (2-4 hours)

### Step 1: Customize Your Configuration
1. Copy `PORTFOLIO_VIDEO_CONFIG.env.example` to `PORTFOLIO_VIDEO_CONFIG.env`
2. Fill in your personal details:
   - Name and target role
   - Contact information and CTAs
   - Brand colors and fonts
3. Review the script in `PORTFOLIO_VIDEO_SCRIPT.md` and personalize:
   - Replace all `[Your Name]` placeholders
   - Adjust the "Why Me" section (3:45-4:30) to highlight your unique strengths
   - Customize the "What I'm looking for" paragraph to match your goals

### Step 2: Gather Visual Assets
Create a folder structure:
```
portfolio-video/
├── assets/
│   ├── product-screenshots/
│   ├── b-roll/
│   ├── diagrams/
│   ├── icons/
│   └── logo/
├── audio/
│   ├── voiceover/
│   └── music/
└── exports/
```

Collect:
- [ ] Screenshots of the Aetheria interface (constellation view, quest cards, dashboard)
- [ ] Your headshot photo (if using talking-head mode)
- [ ] Logo files (PNG with transparency)
- [ ] Icon set for diagrams (can use free sources like Phosphor Icons)

### Step 3: Script Preparation
1. Print or display the script on a second monitor
2. Highlight your speaking parts
3. Mark pauses and emphasis points
4. Practice reading aloud 2-3 times, timing yourself
   - Target: 4 minutes total
   - Aim for 150-160 words per minute

## Phase 2: Recording (2-3 hours)

### Voiceover Recording Setup

**Equipment needed** (minimum):
- Decent microphone (USB mic like Blue Yeti or even good earbuds)
- Quiet room with soft surfaces (closet with clothes works great)
- Audio recording software (Audacity - free, or Adobe Audition)

**Recording tips**:
1. Do a 10-second test recording to check levels
2. Stand up while recording for better vocal projection
3. Keep water nearby, clear your throat before starting
4. Record in segments (each Act separately) to make editing easier
5. Do 2-3 takes of each section, pick the best later
6. Leave 2 seconds of silence at start and end for clean editing

**Quality checklist**:
- [ ] No background noise (fans, traffic, computer hum)
- [ ] Consistent volume throughout
- [ ] Clear articulation (no mumbling or rushing)
- [ ] Natural pacing with strategic pauses
- [ ] Energy appropriate to content (not monotone, not over-excited)

### Headshot Recording (if applicable)

**Equipment needed**:
- Webcam or smartphone camera (1080p minimum)
- Ring light or natural window light
- Clean, uncluttered background

**Recording tips**:
1. Position camera at eye level
2. Frame yourself in lower right third of screen (leave space for graphics)
3. Look slightly off-camera toward script/teleprompter
4. Record 2-3 versions of each segment
5. Keep facial expressions subtle and professional

## Phase 3: Visual Production (4-8 hours)

### Recommended Tools

**Option A: Professional** (paid, full control)
- Adobe After Effects for motion graphics
- Adobe Premiere Pro for editing
- Figma for designing static cards and diagrams

**Option B: Accessible** (free/affordable, easier learning curve)
- DaVinci Resolve (free video editor)
- Canva Pro for motion graphics templates
- Keynote/PowerPoint with export to video

**Option C: Quick AI-assisted** (fastest, less customization)
- Descript (automatic captions, easy editing)
- Pictory.ai (generates video from script)
- Canva Video with templates

### Creating Visual Sequences

#### For Each Act, Create:

**Act 1 - Problem (0:30-1:15)**:
1. Screen recording of a boring traditional LMS (can use Canvas demo)
2. Simple flowchart diagram (use Figma or Canva)
   - Template: Rectangle → Arrow → Rectangle → Hourglass → Question mark
3. Declining graph animation (use chart tool, export as video)
4. Text overlay: "40% Drop-Out Rate" with red highlight

**Act 2 - Insight (1:15-2:00)**:
1. Split-screen comparison (game vs. LMS)
2. Three pillars graphic (three columns with icons)
3. Theme showcase: 2-second clips of each Aetheria theme
4. Before/After two-column comparison

**Act 3 - Solution (2:00-3:00)**:
1. Simplified flowchart with icons (teacher → realm → quest → student)
2. Success animation: XP bar filling, star glowing, artifact appearing
3. Failure pathway: Different color, showing constructive loop
4. Dashboard mockup (clean up actual interface or recreate simplified version)

**Act 4 - Impact (3:00-3:45)**:
1. Three outcome cards appearing sequentially
2. Tradeoffs comparison table
3. Key quote on screen: "Every design decision is a bet"

**Act 5 - Why Me (3:45-4:30)**:
1. Four competency cards in quadrants
2. Optional: Talking head footage
3. End card with name, role, CTA, contact info

### Animation Guidelines

**Timing Reference**:
- Text fade-in: 0.3 seconds
- Card appearance: 0.5 seconds
- Section transitions: 1 second cross-dissolve
- Hold text on screen: Minimum 2 seconds for readability

**Movement**:
- Use "ease-out" easing for most animations (starts fast, slows down)
- Keep movements subtle (10-20% opacity changes, small position shifts)
- Avoid spinning or bouncing unless it serves a specific purpose

## Phase 4: Editing & Assembly (3-5 hours)

### Editing Workflow

1. **Set up your timeline**:
   - Import all voiceover segments
   - Import music track (if using)
   - Create video tracks for graphics and B-roll

2. **Lay down foundation**:
   - Place voiceover on primary audio track
   - Add music on secondary audio track at -22dB
   - Mark timecodes for each Act on timeline

3. **Add visuals in order**:
   - Start with hook (0:00-0:30)
   - Work through each Act sequentially
   - Sync graphics to appear WITH voiceover, not before

4. **Polish pass**:
   - Add transitions between sections
   - Check audio levels (voiceover should be clearly louder than music)
   - Add captions (most editors have auto-caption features now)
   - Color grade if needed (slight contrast boost, saturation adjustment)

5. **Final review**:
   - Watch full video 2-3 times
   - Check for typos in on-screen text
   - Verify all timings match script
   - Test audio on different devices (laptop speakers, phone, headphones)

### Music Integration

**If including music**:
1. Select ambient track (see script recommendations in Section 7)
2. Fade in over 3 seconds at start
3. Keep volume at -20dB to -25dB (much quieter than voice)
4. Consider removing during "Tradeoffs" section (3:15-3:45) for emphasis
5. Fade out over 3 seconds at end

**Free music sources**:
- YouTube Audio Library (free, no attribution needed)
- Artlist.io (subscription, high quality)
- Epidemic Sound (subscription, huge library)
- Uppbeat (free with attribution)

---

## Phase 5: Captioning & Accessibility (1-2 hours)

### Adding Captions

**Automated options**:
- YouTube auto-captions (upload, let YouTube generate, download SRT)
- Descript (automatic transcription included)
- Rev.com (paid human captions, most accurate)
- Kapwing (free auto-captions)

**Manual refinement**:
1. Review auto-generated captions for accuracy
2. Break lines at natural speech pauses
3. Keep line length under 42 characters
4. Display 1-2 lines at a time maximum
5. Use white text on black semi-transparent box (70% opacity)

**Styling guidelines**:
- Font: Sans-serif (Arial, Helvetica, Inter)
- Size: Large enough to read on mobile (typically 28-36pt)
- Position: Bottom center, never covering on-screen graphics
- Timing: Appear 0.5 seconds before spoken words for reading time

### Accessibility Checklist

- [ ] Captions included for all spoken content
- [ ] On-screen text has 4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum
- [ ] Color is not the only way information is conveyed (use icons + text)
- [ ] No flashing or strobing effects
- [ ] Audio description provided if complex visuals are shown without narration
- [ ] Transcript available as separate document

### LinkedIn Post Template

```
40% of students drop out of online courses. Not because the content is too hard—because the experience is boring.

I spent [X weeks/months] redesigning a learning management system from the ground up, applying systems thinking, game design psychology, and AI to create an experience students actually want to use.

This 4-minute video explains:
• The real problem I was solving
• The strategic tradeoffs I made
• The measurable impact on teachers and students
• How I think about product work

No jargon. No code. Just clear thinking about complex problems.

If you're looking for someone who can think systematically and communicate clearly across technical and non-technical teams, let's connect.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "My voiceover sounds flat"
**Fix**: Stand up while recording, smile (it changes your tone), imagine you're explaining to one specific person

### "Visuals look amateurish"
**Fix**: Use fewer elements with more white space, stick to 2-3 colors max, increase font sizes, use professional templates

### "Video feels too long"
**Fix**: Cut the 90-second version first (see Section 8 of main script), test if that feels better

### "Timing is off between voice and visuals"
**Fix**: Make visuals appear WITH voiceover or 0.5 seconds after, never before

### "Audio quality is poor"
**Fix**: Record in smaller room with soft materials, use noise reduction in post, keep mic close to mouth (6-8 inches)

### "Can't afford professional tools"
**Fix**: Use free alternatives: DaVinci Resolve (editing), Canva free (graphics), phone camera (recording), Audacity (audio)

### "Don't want to show my face"
**Fix**: Use avatar_mode="none" and focus on strong voiceover with excellent visuals
