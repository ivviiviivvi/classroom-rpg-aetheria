## Technical Details

### Production Pipeline

The video was generated using an autonomous production pipeline:

1. **Script Parsing**: Extracts scenes and timecodes from Markdown script
2. **Audio Generation**: Converts text to speech using espeak TTS engine
3. **Visual Generation**: Creates title cards with FFmpeg
4. **Video Rendering**: Combines audio and visuals into final MP4
5. **Quality Assurance**: Generates detailed production log

### Audio Quality

The current version uses **espeak**, a free, open-source TTS engine. For improved audio quality:

- Replace with professional voiceover recording
- Use commercial TTS services (Amazon Polly, Google Text-to-Speech)
- Edit the generated audio file and re-render

### Visual Enhancement

The current version uses simple title cards. To enhance:

- Add actual application screenshots
- Include animated transitions
- Add B-roll footage (concepts are documented in the script)
- Create custom graphics for key concepts

See `satellites/portfolio/PORTFOLIO_VIDEO_STORYBOARD.md` for detailed visual specifications.
