# Aetheria: The Living Classroom - Product Requirements Document

Aetheria transforms traditional Learning Management Systems into an immersive, gamified 3D experience where courses become "Realms," assignments become "Quests," and student progress is visualized through glowing "Constellations" in a living, responsive environment.

**Experience Qualities**:
1. **Immersive** - Users should feel transported into a digital universe rather than using "just another education tool," achieved through 3D spatial navigation, glassmorphism UI, dynamic theming, ambient particle effects, and smooth animations that respond to their chosen reality.
2. **Empowering** - Both teachers and students should feel like powerful creators and adventurers respectively, reinforced through gamification mechanics (XP, levels, loot, level-up celebrations) and the recursive AI Oracle that provides immediate, constructive feedback loops.
3. **Alive** - The interface should feel reactive and breathing, with floating particles, smooth progress animations, pulsing constellation stars, parallax effects, and smooth transitions that make every interaction feel consequential and magical.

**Complexity Level**: Complex Application (advanced functionality, accounts)
- This is a dual-role LMS with sophisticated state management for courses/assignments/submissions, AI-powered recursive learning generation, animated canvas visualizations, dynamic theming system, and persistent user progression tracking across multiple data entities.

### Feature 11: Welcome Dialog with Name Entry
- **Functionality**: First-time users are prompted to enter their hero name before accessing the app
- **Purpose**: Personalizes the experience and establishes user identity in the system
- **Trigger**: App loads and detects no user name in profile
- **Progression**: App loads → Name dialog appears (modal, non-dismissible) → User enters name → Clicks "Begin Adventure" → Profile created with unique ID → Dialog closes → User enters app
- **Success Criteria**: Dialog blocks all interaction until name entered; name persists across sessions; profile gets unique ID for leaderboard tracking

## Edge Case Handling

- **Empty States**: New users see a tutorial Realm with sample Quest; empty inventories show "No artifacts yet" with encouraging message; empty Archives show placeholder for first Knowledge Crystal
- **AI Generation Failures**: If Oracle API fails, show graceful error with retry button; submission is saved locally and can be re-evaluated; fallback generic feedback provided
- **Network Interruptions**: All form inputs persist via useKV; unsaved submissions show warning banner; offline state disables Oracle but allows local navigation
- **Extreme Data**: Constellation view intelligently clusters if >20 quests; Realm Map uses pagination or zoom levels if >10 realms; Inventory uses scrollable grid for >12 artifacts
- **Performance**: 3D animations pause when tab is backgrounded; particle count reduces on mobile; heavy blur effects simplify on lower-end devices

## Design Direction

The design should evoke a sense of wonder and power, blending the ethereal beauty of floating glass interfaces with the tactile satisfaction of video game progression systems. The aesthetic pulls from sci-fi HUDs (Halo, Mass Effect) and fantasy RPGs (World of Warcraft talent trees, Destiny's director map) while maintaining clarity and accessibility. The interface should feel simultaneously futuristic and magical, with every interaction reinforced by purposeful motion and light.

## Font Selection

Typography should reinforce each theme's narrative while maintaining exceptional readability across dense content.

**Fantasy**: Cinzel (headers) + Crimson Pro (body) - Elegant serifs that evoke medieval manuscripts and arcane tomes
**Sci-Fi**: Orbitron (headers) + Roboto Mono (body) - Geometric and monospaced fonts suggesting computer terminals and digital displays
**Medieval**: IM Fell English (headers) + Lora (body) - Classic blackletter feel softened with readable serif body
**Modern**: Inter (universal) - Clean, highly legible sans-serif for professional education environment

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Page Title/Realm Name): Theme-specific Bold / 36px / tight (-0.02em)
  - H2 (Section Headers): Theme-specific Semibold / 28px / tight (-0.01em)
  - H3 (Quest Titles): Theme-specific Semibold / 20px / normal

  - UI Labels: Theme-specific Medium / 14px / normal / uppercase for buttons
  - Captions (XP/Stats): Theme-specific Regular / 12px / wide (0.05em)

## Animations

Animations should feel powerful and consequential while maintaining clarity - every motion should communicate meaning, whether it's the weight of a successful quest submission or the ethereal float of glass panels.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Motion reinforces the "living world" metaphor - particles drift to show depth, UI panels slide from impossible spaces (like HUD elements materializing), quest cards flip to reveal results creating dramatic reveals
- **Hierarchy of Movement**:
  - Critical (Quest submission result, Level up): 800ms dramatic scale + glow pulse + screen flash
  - Important (XP gain, Constellation star lighting): 500ms smooth fade-in + subtle scale
  - Standard (Navigation, Panel transitions): 300ms ease-out slides
  - Ambient (Particle drift, 3D rotation): Continuous slow motion at 0.2-0.5 speed
  - Micro (Button hover, Card lift): 150ms spring-like response

## Component Selection

- **Components**: 
  - **Dialog** for Quest submission interface and Knowledge Crystal modals (full-screen overlay)
  - **Card** for Quest items, Artifacts in inventory, Knowledge Crystals (with custom glass styling)
  - **Progress** for XP bar (styled as liquid/energy fill)
  - **Tabs** for switching between Quests/Archives/Constellation within a Realm
  - **Button** with heavy customization for theme-specific glows and hover states
  - **Textarea** for quest submissions

  - Quest Cards: Locked (greyed + lock icon), Available (pulsing border), In Progress (orange accent), Completed (green check + lit effect), Failed (red + redemption link)
  - Constellation Stars: Unlit (grey circle), Lit (golden glow + rays), Active/Hover (scale + tooltip)
  - 3D Nodes: Idle (slow rotation), Hover (faster rotation + glow + scale 1.2x), Active (zoom camera toward)

- **Icon Selection**: 
  - @phosphor-icons: `Sword`, `Castle`, `Scroll`, `Crown` (Fantasy) | `Brain`, `Terminal`, `CircuitBoard`, `Cube` (Sci-Fi) | `Shield`, `Flag`, `Scepter` (Medieval) | `Book`, `GraduationCap`, `ChalkboardTeacher` (Modern)
  - Navigation: `House` (World Map), `User` (Character), `BookOpen` (Archives), `Target` (Quests)
  - Actions: `Play` (Start Quest), `PaperPlaneRight` (Submit), `ArrowCounterClockwise` (Retry), `Star` (Favorite)

- **Spacing**: 
  - Glass panels: `p-6` internal padding, `gap-4` between sections
  - Card grids: `gap-6` for quest lists, `gap-4` for inventory items
  - Sidebar: `space-y-6` for major sections, `space-y-2` for menu items
  - Form fields: `space-y-4` for question groups
  - Consistent `border-2` for glass panel borders, `rounded-xl` for cards, `rounded-full` for avatar/badges

- **Mobile**: 
  - Sidebar collapses to hamburger menu at <768px
  - 3D Realm Map shows single centered node with left/right arrows for navigation (replaces mouse parallax)
  - Quest cards stack vertically in single column
  - Constellation view allows pinch-zoom instead of fixed viewport
  - XP bar moves to top of screen as sticky header
  - Inventory grid reduces to 2 columns on mobile
  - All glass panels become full-width with reduced blur for performance
